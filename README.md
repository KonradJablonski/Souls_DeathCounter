<b>Info:</b>
The idea behind this software is to run this along side your twitch stream where it will report automatically your death count.
The death count is retrived from RAM. As this application only READS the information, it will not be picked up by anti-cheat system.
Reading directly from RAM requires Admin rights, so you will be required to run this application as an admin.

<b>How To Use:</b>
1. Run the application.
2. Run your game load your save. 
3. Get death count from the app screen, or you can use deaths.txt. This text file is updated at the same time as the screen.
4. Go to Settings.txt to modifiy Font Color, Font Size, Font Type and Font Style of the death counter text.

<b>StreamLabs: </b>
1. Run the "Universal_Game_DeathCounter" app.
2. Run StreamLabs.
3. In StreamLabs, add new Source "Window Capture"
4. Under Window, select the "Universal_Game_DeathCounter" app.
5. Untick "Capture Cursor" and press Done.
6. Now you need to get rid of the gray box surrounding the text. 
7. Right Click on the just created source and select "Filters"
8. Add new Filter type "Color Key"
9. Select custom color. The background color is in RGB "64,64,64" or in hex 404040
10. Tweak anyother settings to your liking.
11. Press Done.
Now you should have transparent death counter. Next you can put a custom text next to it, something like "DEATHS".
